    <h2>1- Add two Numbers</h2>
    You are provided with two numbers A and B . Your task is to add these two
    numbers. Note: You have to complete AddTwoNumbers function. No need to take
    any input.

    <pre> Ans- const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) =&gt; {
    
        return a+b;
    };</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>2- Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?</h2>
    You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both
    conditions ( A &lt; 10 and A &gt; B ) are satisfied or not with the help of
    operators. Note: You have to complete Is_Valid function. No need to take any
    input.
    <pre>Ans-  const Is_Valid = (a,b) =&gt; {
  
    return (a&lt;10&amp;&amp;a&gt;b);
  };</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>3- Check the conditons</h2>
    You are given two numbers A and B . You need to do the following checks:
    <br>

    (1.if both are divisible by 10 console true.) <br>
    (2.if both are not divisible by 10 console false.) <br>
    (3.if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.) <br>

    <pre>Ans-  const Check = (A, B) =&gt; 
    {
       
        return (A%10==0)||(B%10==0)?true:false ;
    };</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>4- Find the first digit of a 4 digit number</h2>
    You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the
    first digit of that number. Note: You have to complete First_Digit function.
    No need to take any input.
    <pre>Ans-  const First_Digit = (n) =&gt; {
        return (parseInt(n/1000))
     };</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>5- Find the last digit of a 4 digit number</h2>
    You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the
    last digit of that number. Note: You have to complete Last_Digit function.
    No need to take any input.
    <pre>Ans-  const Last_Digit = (n) =&gt; {
        return (n % 10)
     };</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>6- Find the remainder</h2>
    You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as divisor and B as
    dividend.Your task is find the remainder. Note: You have to complete
    Find_the_remainder function. No need to take any input.
    <pre>Ans-  const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) =&gt; {
    return b % a;
    };</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>7- Multipy two Numbers</h2>
    You are provided with two numbers A and B . Your task is to multiply these
    two numbers. Note: You have to complete Multiply_two_number function. No
    need to take any input.
    <pre>Ans-  const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) =&gt; {
    return a * b;
};</pre>

    <h2>8- Marks Calculator</h2>
    Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A , B , and C (out of
    100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average. Note: You
    have to complete Sum and Average functions. No need to take any input.
    <pre>Ans-  const Sum = (A, B, C) =&gt; 
    {
     return A+B+C;
    };
    
    const Average = (A, B, C) =&gt; 
    {
     return ((A+B+C)/3);
    };</pre>
