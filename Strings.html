  <h2>1- Count Characters</h2>
  You are given a string S , and your task is to return an array B ( having a
  size of 2 ) , where B [ 0 ] contains the count of character A (uppercase) in
  string S and B [ 1 ] contains the count of character D (uppercase) in string
  S. Note: You have to complete countCharacters function. No need to take any
  input.
  <pre>Ans-  const countCharacters = (S) =&gt; 
    {
