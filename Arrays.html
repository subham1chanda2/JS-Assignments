    elements by 1 and then print whole array. You have to complete Inc_Arr. No
    need to take any input.
    <pre>Ans-  const Inc_Arr = (array,N) =&gt; 
    {
      let arr1 =""
      for(let p of array){

    <h2>8- Pass or Fail</h2>
    You are given an array A containing the maths marks of students in your
    class, and your task is to determine if all the students pass in your class
    or not. A student is declared pass if his maths marks are greater than or
    equal to 32 . If all the students pass in your class, return "YES" (without
    quotes); otherwise, return "NO" (without quotes). Note: You have to complete
    isAllPass function. No need to take any input.
    <pre>Ans-  const isAllPass = (N, Arr) =&gt;

    <h2>9- Unique Color Shirt</h2>
    Prepbuddy is very tasteful of clothes. He has N numbers of shirts hanging in
    the hanger in his wardrobe. Prepbuddy likes to wear different colored
    clothes. So, whenever he see there are two or more shirts with the same
    color, he removes all the shirt of that color from his wardrobe. Now, he
    wants to know how many M unique color shirts are left in the wardrobe.
    Prepbuddy wants you to find M . Note: As there are many shades of a color so
    consider integers as a color name. i.e, color of shirt is 0,1,2, â€¦ , N.
    <pre>Ans-  function Unique_Shirts (arr,N) {
    let arr1=Array(10000).fill(0);
    for(let p of arr){
      arr1[p]+=1
    }
    let count=0;
    for (let p of arr1){
      if(p===1){
        count+=1
      }
    }
    return count;

    <h2>10- Min and Max</h2>
    Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly
    simple array problem to solve. If you know how to iterate through the array,
    you will easily be able to solve this. The problem statement is simple-
    given N elements, find the minimum and maximum numbers among those elements.
    <pre>Ans-   function arrayMin(arr) {
    let min=arr[0];
    for (let p of arr){
      if(min&gt;p){
        min=p;
      }
    }
    return min;
  
  }
  
  function arrayMax(arr) {
   let max=arr[0]
   for(let p of arr){
     if(max<p){ max="p;" }="" return="" max;="" }<="" pre="">

    <h2>11- Birthday Game</h2>
    Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much
    and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares
    consists of an integer represented by A [ i ] . She decides to share a
    contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the
    segment matches Yatharth's birth month M and the sum of the integers on the
    squares is equal to his birthday D . You must determine how many ways she
    can divide the chocolate.
    <pre>Ans-  function Birthday_Game(arr,D ,M) {
    let finalCount=0;
    for(let p=0;p&lt;(arr.toString().length-M);p++){
      let count=0;
      for(let b=p;b&lt;(p+M);b++){
        count+=arr[b];
      }
      if(count===D){
        finalCount+=1
      }
    }
    return finalCount;
   
   }</pre>
