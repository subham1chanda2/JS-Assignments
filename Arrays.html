    <h2>1- Calculator</h2>
    Write a program to make a simple calculator using switch statement that takes operator and two numbers from user and print the result after operation.

Note: You have to complete Calculator. No need to take any input
<pre>Ans-  const Calculator = (A, B, C) =&gt; 
    {
        switch(A){
          case "+":
            return B+C;
            
            case "-":
              return B-C;
              
              case "*":
                return B*C;

        }
        
    };</pre><br>
    <h2>2- Check whether the condition is fulfilled or not?</h2>
    Write a program that takes a number and prints whether the number is divisible by 
6
 and 
9
 or not.

Note: You have to complete Check_divisibility. No need to take any input
<pre>Ans-  const Check_divisibility = (N) =&gt; {
    return((N%6===0)&amp;&amp;(N%9===0))?
    "Divisible by both":
    "Not Divisible by both"
    
};</pre><br>
<h2>3- Eligible Voter</h2>
You are given an integer 
A
, denoting the age of a person, and your task is to determine whether he/she is eligible to vote or not.

Note: You have to complete isEligible function. No need to take any input
<pre>Ans-  const isEligible = (a) =&gt; {
    let result = a &gt; 18 ? ("Eligible for Voting") : ("Not Eligible for Voting")
    return result;
 };</pre><br>
 <h2>4- Find Relation</h2>
 PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values 
X
 and 
Y
 and asks you to find the relation between them.
The relationships between integers 
X
 and 
Y
 are as follows: <br>

If 
X
&lt;
Y
, it means that 
X
 is smaller than 
Y
. <br>
If 
X
&gt;
Y
, it means that 
X
 is greater than 
Y
. <br>
If 
X
=
Y
, it means that 
X
 is equal to 
Y
. 
Note: You have to complete findRelationship function. No need to take any input.
<pre>Ans-  const findRelation = (x,y) =&gt; {
    if(x<y){ return="" (x="" +="" "="" is="" smaller="" than="" y);="" }="" else="" if(x="">y){
      return (x + " is greater than " + y);
    }
      else{
      return (x + " is equal to " + y);
    }
};</y){></pre> <br>
<h2>5- Find Grades</h2>
Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(M) obtained by a student:
<br>
If 
M
≤
10
, the grade will be 
E
. <br>
If 
11
≥
M
≤
20
, the grade will be 
D
. <br>
If 
21
≥
M
≤
30
, the grade will be 
C
. <br>
If 
31
≥
M
≤
40
, the grade will be 
B
. <br>
If 
41
≥
M
≤
50
, the grade will be 
A
. <br>
Your friend will enter his marks out of 
50
, and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement.

Note: You have to complete findGrades function. No need to take any input.
<pre>Ans-  const findGrades = (a) =&gt; {
